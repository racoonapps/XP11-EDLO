EDLO known as Oerlinghausen Segelflugplatz, German for Oerlinghausen gliding airfield, is a small airfield situated in the town of Oerlinghausen close to Bielefeld in the North Rhine-Westphalia German region. With around 25,000 glider take-offs each year it is one of the largest gliding centres. It is also used by motor planes, microlights and hot air balloons. The airfield is home to 13 gliding clubs and to a gliding school.

This is my first try to bring some life to this airfield using WED. I've used free to use Orthophotos provided by the state of North Rhine Westphalia, used some objects from different libraries as mentioned below. It is not perfect, I am still working on my Blender skills to create some more real-life objects. Also I am no pilot so do not have access to the airfield itself to take photos to recreate the buildings in X-Plane. If anyone here is member at EDLO: I would love to visit the airfield and take photos of the hangars, buildings and so on, maybe there is a chance :-)
